## 📍 How I built it

I have build this service file with the knowledge that I learned during the Inhouse Training of college (Non-Teaching Credit Course). First, Read various ducomentations and watched tutorials to understand PyQt5 GUI Designing and then completed all the User-Interface Design using PyQt5 Designer. Then, provided them the backbone with the Python Programming.

## 📍 Challenges I ran into

There is a big difference between learning and practical implementation of that learning. As I was building this app, there were many concepts that I had to go-through again.

## 📍 What I learned

Web Scraping was totally new field for me to work. But while working on this project, I got a hand-on experience on working on Web Scraping and GUI designing using Python Programming
